# VideoSnap App Development Summary

This document summarizes the features implemented in the VideoSnap Android application, outlines remaining tasks, and suggests potential improvements.

## Implemented Features

### Architecture & Build System
*   **Modular Gradle Setup:** Utilizes a modular Gradle setup with version catalogs (`libs.versions.toml`) for dependency management.
*   **Android Studio & Jetpack Compatibility:** Compatible with Android Studio and leverages modern Jetpack libraries, including Jetpack Compose and WorkManager.
*   **Native Code Integration:** Configured to build native C++ code using CMake and the Android NDK.
*   **MLT Framework Integration:** The MLT (Media Lovin' Toolkit) framework is integrated as a native dependency for core video processing.
*   **Kotlin Multiplatform:** The project has been migrated to a Kotlin Multiplatform structure with `shared` and `androidApp` modules.

### Core Features
*   **Video Playback:** Users can select and play videos from their device's storage.
*   **Multi-track Timeline:** A multi-track timeline is implemented, allowing for basic arrangement of video clips.
*   **Timeline Scrubbing:** Users can scrub through the video using a timeline slider.
*   **Drag and Drop:** Clips on the timeline support drag-and-drop with visual feedback (ghosting and drop indicators).
*   **Audio Waveforms:** The timeline displays visual representations of audio waveforms for each clip, generated asynchronously.
*   **MLT-powered Operations:**
    *   **Video Information:** Retrieves basic video information (e.g., duration) using MLT.
    *   **Trimming:** Allows trimming a video to a specified start and end time with a dynamic UI.
    *   **Splitting:** Enables splitting a video into two parts at a designated point, with a dynamic UI.
    *   **Effects:** Can apply a selection of effects to a video, including grayscale, sepia, invert, and oldfilm.
    *   **Multi-track Audio Mixing:** Can mix audio from all tracks into a single file.
    *   **Keyframe Animation:** Can apply keyframe animations to video properties.
    *   **Text Overlays:** Can add and customize text overlays on videos.
    *   **Picture-in-Picture (PiP):** Can overlay a video on top of another.
    *   **Speed Ramping:** Can apply variable speed adjustments to videos.
    *   **Motion Tracking:** Can track the motion of an object in a video.
    *   **Export Presets:** Offers a selection of export presets for various social media platforms.
*   **Background Rendering:** Utilizes Android WorkManager to perform video export operations in the background, preventing UI blocking.
*   **Project Management:**
    *   **Project Versioning & Recovery:** The app now saves a history of project states, allowing users to revert to previous versions.
    *   **Explicit Save/Load:** Users can now explicitly save and load their projects.
*   **Cloud Integration:**
    *   **Google Drive Import:** Users can import videos from their Google Drive.
    *   **Cloud Backup:** Users can back up their projects to Google Drive.
*   **AI-powered Features:**
    *   **Smart Editing Suggestions:** The app can now detect silent parts of a video and suggest splits.
    *   **Automated Color Correction:** The app can now automatically adjust the black and white points of a video.
    *   **Speech-to-Text for Subtitles:** The app can now automatically generate subtitles from a video.

### UI/UX Design
*   **Jetpack Compose UI:** The entire user interface is built using Jetpack Compose for a modern Android experience.
*   **Glossy, Neon-Accented Theme:** A custom theme with a glossy, neon aesthetic is implemented.
*   **Intuitive Layout:** The UI includes a clear video preview area, the multi-track timeline, and accessible playback/editing controls.
*   **Timeline Interactivity:**
    *   **Clip Resizing:** Users can resize clips directly on the timeline.
    *   **Track Management:** Users can add, remove, and adjust the height of tracks.
*   **Media & Project Management:**
    *   **Media Import Screen:** A dedicated screen for importing media from various sources.
    *   **Project Manager Screen:** A dedicated screen for managing multiple projects.
*   **Export Progress UI:** Displays real-time progress and notifications for background export tasks.
*   **Responsive Layouts:** The app now has a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
*   **Onboarding Flow:** An onboarding sequence guides new users through the app's core features on their first launch.
*   **Tooltips & Contextual Help:** Provides tooltips for various UI elements to offer immediate, context-sensitive assistance.
*   **Customizable UI:** Users can now customize the theme colors.

### Error Handling
*   **MLT Error Handling:** The app now handles errors that occur during MLT operations and provides user feedback.

### Documentation
*   **KDoc Documentation:** All public classes and functions are now documented with KDoc comments.

## What Needs to Be Done (Remaining Tasks)


4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Asynchronous Waveform Generation:** Done.
    *   **Optimized MLT Calls:** Ensure MLT operations are performed efficiently and asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
    *   **Compose Recomposition Analysis:** Profile and optimize Jetpack Compose UI performance by minimizing unnecessary recompositions using the Layout Inspector.
    *   **Memory Profiling:** Actively profile the app using Android Studio's memory profiler to identify and fix memory leaks, particularly at the JNI boundary.
    *   **App Startup Time:** Analyze and reduce the application's startup time (Time to Initial Display) by deferring non-essential initializations.

## Possibilities for Improvement

*   **Performance Monitoring:** Integrate performance monitoring tools to identify and address bottlenecks.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is fully accessible to users with disabilities.
*   **Internationalization:** Support multiple languages.

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

To ensure application quality, stability, and maintainability, a multi-layered testing strategy will be implemented.

### Unit Tests
*   **Scope:** Test individual classes and functions in isolation.
*   **Targets:** ViewModels, Repositories, UseCases, Mappers, and utility functions. (AudioWaveformGenerator is the first to be tested).
*   **Frameworks:** JUnit 5, MockK for creating test doubles of dependencies.

### UI & Instrumentation Tests
*   **Scope:** Verify UI components and user flows on a device or emulator.
*   **Targets:** Critical user journeys, such as video selection, timeline editing (drag/drop, trim), and the export flow. Test individual Composable components in isolation to verify their state rendering.
*   **Frameworks:** Jetpack Compose Test APIs, Espresso, and AndroidX Test-runner and -rules.

### Integration Tests
*   **Scope:** Test interactions between different modules and layers of the app.
*   **Targets:**
    *   The full data flow from UI interactions to the database/native layer.
    *   WorkManager background tasks for video processing and exporting.
    *   Integration between the Kotlin/Android layer and the native C++/MLT layer to ensure correct data passing and handling.

### Native (C++) Code Tests
*   **Scope:** Unit test the native C++ code that wraps the MLT framework.
*   **Targets:** Functions responsible for creating MLT profiles, producers, filters, and consumers.
*   **Frameworks:** GoogleTest.
