# Video Snap App Development Summary

This document summarizes the work done so far on the Video Snap Android app.

## Project Structure

I have restructured the project to follow a clean architecture pattern. The main packages are:

* `data`: Contains data sources, such as the `ProjectManager` and `ExportWorker`.
* `domain`: Contains the core business logic and data models, such as `VideoProject`, `Timeline`, and `Effect`.
* `presentation`: Contains the UI logic, including `MainActivity`, `VideoEditorViewModel`, and the various screens.
* `ui`: Contains the UI components, such as `VideoPreview`, `TimelineView`, and `EffectsPanel`.
* `util`: Contains utility classes, such as `MltHelper` and `DragAndDrop`.

## Core Features

I have implemented the following core features:

* **Project Management:** The `ProjectManager` can save and load video projects.
* **Video Playback:** The `VideoPreview` uses ExoPlayer to display the video.
* **Timeline:** The `TimelineView` displays the video and audio tracks, and allows for basic drag-and-drop of clips.
* **Effects:** The `EffectsPanel` displays a list of available effects and allows them to be applied to clips.

## Next Steps

My next steps are to:

* Implement the native FFmpeg and MLT dependencies.
* Flesh out the timeline functionality, including trimming, splitting, and ripple delete.
* Implement the audio waveform visualization.
* Implement the export functionality.
* Improve the UI/UX.
